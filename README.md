# Bike Sales Excel Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data using Microsoft Excel. I tackled a dataset of bike sales to demonstrate robust data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of an interactive dashboard for business insights.

## Key Features
-> Data Cleaning: Applied Excel functions and formulas to cleanse the dataset, such as removing duplicates, fixing anomalies, and normalizing data formats.

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough analysis to understand the underlying patterns and trends within the data, focusing on variables such as gender, income, commute distance, region, education, profession, and age group.

-> Dashboard Creation: Developed an interactive Excel dashboard that provides dynamic insights into bike sales trends with options to drill down based on various demographic and geographic segments.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

## Visualizations
The dashboard incorporates several visual components to illustrate the findings from the EDA:

-> Bar Charts: Used to compare sales across different professions and education levels.

-> Line Charts: Deployed to show trends over time, segmented by age group and income.
